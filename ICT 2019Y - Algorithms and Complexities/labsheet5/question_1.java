// Question 1
// Suppose that you have been given an array which contains one or more duplicates. Write a program to
// remove all duplicates from array. For example, if the array is {1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} then your program should
// return the array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
// Note that there is no way to delete an element from an array. If substituting with another value is not an
// option, then you need to create another array to mimic deletion.
